# Anexos

This is a project that I create following the tutorial on youtube [Curso de Java desde 0][def] to strength my knowledge in Java and learn some advanced concepts. In this case is to workaround advanced swing, introspection, java beans and javadoc.
It has some dependencies:

- jcalendar-1.4.jar
- mysql-connector-j-8.0.31.jar
